# Cochlear-implant
This project already has the Python code in the internet. In this project, the requirement from my old university friend , which he studies in Australia is convert the function in Python into C. This project using Jupyter notebook. This project, I have to figure how to convert two functions: ElFieldToActivity and ActivityToPower, which is inside the function vocoderFunc in Cochlear Implant Simulator.ipynb file, in the 9th item.

First, I have to figure out the value of each variable by using print and run the whole code again in Jupyter Notebook to see the result of the varaible. And then, I commented the line for loop and give a real value, after that I used the code to save csv file that created by Python code. I have to understood the code and then converted into C code, save the result into the csv file and check between 2 csv files from Python and C.

In this project, I have learnt about syntax and the numpy library in Python, and still trying to improve the coding strategy day by day.
